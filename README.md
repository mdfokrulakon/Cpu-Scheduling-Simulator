CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator written in C. It demonstrates how different scheduling techniques manage processes, calculate waiting times, turnaround times, and generate Gantt charts for visualization.

Features
First-Come, First-Served Scheduling (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF) (Non-preemptive)
Round Robin Scheduling
Priority Scheduling (Non-preemptive)
Gantt Chart Visualization
Average Waiting Time Calculation
Interactive CLI-based user interface

Requirements
C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
Terminal / Command Prompt
